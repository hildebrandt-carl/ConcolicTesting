# Test Programs

This directory contains the test programs source code, LLVM bitcode, and test output of a set of tests that we used to test our program. The directory also contains the output from the concolic test we ran and presented in the report.

## Project Sections

* [Bit Code](./bit_code/) - Contains the bit code generated by LLVM for each of the test programs.
* [Concolic Example Run](./concolic_example_run/) - Contains an example run where we used both the symbolic constraints solver and the LLVM dynamic pass to fully explore a program.
* [Source Code](./source_code/) - Contains the source code for all tests which were ran on our LLVM passes.
* [Test Output](./test_output) - Contains the LLVM dynamic pass terminal output for each of the runs.
