\section{Problem}

The goal of this project was to design a concolic testing engine to test programs which are in an LLVM bitcode format. To accomplish this, we first needed to create a transformation pass in LLVM which transforms the program such that when you run it, symbolic constraints are generated showing the execution of that program run. Using these symbolic constraints a test generator would generate new input which executed a new path in the program. This approach could be repeated until all paths of the program were explored or a timeout value reached.

For our problem the LLVM bitcode was generated by two compilers namely, TIPC and Clang. TIPC is a compiler which takes TIP\cite{tip} programs and converts them to LLVM bitcode \cite{tipc}. Clang is a compiler front end which uses the LLVM compiler infrastructure to generate LLVM bitcode for, among others, C and C++ programs. Once the LLVM bitcode was generated. it would have to have LLVM passes run on it to generate the information we need at both compile and run time. This information will then be given to an SMT solver which will generate new inputs to exercise new paths.
